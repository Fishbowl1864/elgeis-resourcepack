# elgeis-resourcepack
Crowdsourced resource pack for Elgeis Minecraft Server

Requires Optifine (or something like the CIT Resewn mod for non Optifine clients) to work properly - without it nothing will break, you just won't see changed textures!

To start us off, an example texture "Goatem of Undying" is provided for reference.

# Rules for Contributing
- All changed textures are through the Optifine CIT system, see documentation: https://optifine.readthedocs.io/cit.html
- Do not make changes to any default MC textures, only renamable custom items throught Optifine CIT as seen above
- Only do this to "your own stuff", e.g. don't make a retexture for "Montrosian Standard-Issue Sword" without the approval of the people who make such items
- For example, if making changes to a Brewery recipe's texture, you must have the approval of the person who originally contributed the recipe
- Harmful or disruptive additions to the pack may result in your removal from the community, so best behavior please!
- Staff reserve the right to reject contributions or request revisions if such contributions fall afoul of these rules or general good-faith participation.
